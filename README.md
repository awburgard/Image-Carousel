# Mood Ring Carousel

## Description
Mood Ring Carousel is an assignment that allows users to attach tags to different images. The user can cycle through the images and add as many tags as they want

## Database Setup
1. Create a database named `saga_weekend`
2. Run the queries from `database.sql` on the `saga_weekend` database.
3. You will need to create the junction table between the `images` and `tags` tables! Your app will be populating this new table.

## Install Dependencies
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run server`
3. `npm run client`

## Reflection of Learning
When did this project occur?
   - This project occurred during our 6th week of the classroom.

What did you learn from the project? Technology? Pattern?
   - This assignment handled using Redux-Saga to run axios operations. I learned how important it is to extrapolate the axios calls to Redux-Saga instead of having backend logic in the frontend files. This extrapolation plays an important part in properly understanding MVC.
