# Mood Ring Carousel

## Description

_Duration: 2 Days_

Mood Ring Carousel is an assignment that allows users to attach tags to different images. The user can cycle through the images and add as many tags as they want

## Installation
1. Create a database named `saga_weekend`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!

## Reflection of Learning
When did this project occur?
   - This project occurred during our 6th week of the classroom.

What did you learn from the project? Technology? Pattern?
   - This assignment handled using Redux-Saga to run axios operations. I learned how important it is to extrapolate the axios calls to Redux-Saga instead of having backend logic in the frontend files. This extrapolation plays an important part in properly understanding MVC.
